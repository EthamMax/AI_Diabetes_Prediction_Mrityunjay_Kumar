## How to Use the Application

### Step 1: Enter Your Information
In the sidebar on the left side of the screen, you'll find a form to enter your health information:

- **Number of Pregnancies**: How many times you have been pregnant (enter 0 if not applicable)
- **Glucose Level**: Your blood glucose level in mg/dL (typically measured after fasting)
- **Blood Pressure**: Your diastolic blood pressure in mm Hg
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness in mm
- **Insulin Level**: Your 2-Hour serum insulin level in mu U/ml
- **BMI**: Your Body Mass Index (weight in kg divided by height in meters squared)
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: A score representing your family history of diabetes
- **Age**: Your age in years

### Step 2: Submit for Prediction
Click the "Predict Diabetes Risk" button to submit your information.

### Step 3: Interpret Results
The system will display:
- A risk assessment (High Risk or Low Risk)
- The probability of diabetes
- A detailed interpretation of your risk level
- Key risk factors identified in your data

## Understanding Your Results

### Risk Levels
- **Low Risk** (probability below 30%): The model predicts a low probability of diabetes
- **Moderate Risk** (probability between 30% and 70%): There are some indicators suggesting elevated risk
- **High Risk** (probability above 70%): The model predicts a high probability of diabetes

### Next Steps
Based on your risk level:

- **Low Risk**: Continue maintaining a healthy lifestyle
- **Moderate Risk**: Consider consulting with a healthcare provider
- **High Risk**: Consult with a healthcare provider as soon as possible
